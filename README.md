# CMS-Admin
This is a custom CMS Admin (dashboard and editing pages) that I built using PHP + SQL and CSS. Features include a log of visitor data, unique visitor count, an animated sidebar, CRUD elements and a 'review' page with animated star icons for setting a 'rate' value that stores to the database. This was designed as an admin page for a dynamic CMS driven media review website.
